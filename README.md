*DESCRIPTION*

A recommendation system is a powerful tool widely used in various industries to suggest relevant content to users—like movies, products, or songs—based on their preferences and behaviors. This project focuses on building such a system using collaborative filtering and matrix factorization, two popular techniques in the field of recommender systems.

Collaborative filtering operates on the idea that users with similar preferences in the past are likely to share tastes in the future. There are two main types: user-based and item-based collaborative filtering. For instance, if user A and user B both liked the same movies, then a movie that user B enjoyed (but user A hasn’t watched yet) can be recommended to user A. This model uses a user-item interaction matrix, where rows represent users and columns represent items (such as movies or books), and the values in the matrix denote ratings or interactions.

However, this matrix is often sparse—most users haven’t interacted with most items. To tackle this, we apply matrix factorization techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or Alternating Least Squares (ALS). These techniques reduce the large, sparse matrix into smaller, dense matrices capturing latent features (like genres or themes) that explain user preferences and item characteristics. This approach allows the system to make accurate recommendations even with limited explicit feedback.

For this project, we use a real dataset (such as MovieLens) containing user ratings for movies. We preprocess the data, split it into training and test sets, and build a recommendation engine using either the Surprise library (for SVD-based matrix factorization) or implicit (for ALS). The model learns hidden patterns and predicts how likely a user is to enjoy an item.
